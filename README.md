# Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization 
This repository will contain my solutions.
i'm using primarily java to implement the solutions. 

## About This Specialization

This specialization is a mix of theory and practice: you will learn algorithmic techniques for solving various computational problems and will implement about 100 algorithmic coding problems.For each algorithm you develop and implement, we designed multiple tests to check its correctness and running time â€” you will have to debug your programs without even knowing what these tests are! It may sound difficult, but we believe it is the only way to truly understand how the algorithms work and to master the art of programming. The specialization contains two real-world projects: Big Networks and Genome Assembly. You will analyze both road networks and social networks and will learn how to compute the shortest route between New York and San Francisco (1000 times faster than the standard shortest path algorithms!) Afterwards, you will learn how to assemble genomes from millions of short fragments of DNA and how assembly algorithms fuel recent developments in personalized medicine.
This specialization is created by University of California San Diego and National Research University Higher School of Economics.
